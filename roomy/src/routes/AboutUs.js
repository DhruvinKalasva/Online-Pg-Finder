        <h5>Online <span>PG</span> Finder</h5>
          <p>It has become easy to search pg accommodation nearby the work
            place. It was difficult earlier to go a place to work which was situated at longdistances and hence had to lose good opportunities, as we donâ€™t know where
            to stay and where unaware about a particular city. But now it has become
            easier to find an accommodation nearby the work place in cheap rates. In
            this online paying guest system, users can find a number of paying
            accommodation nearby work place or desired place.</p>
